# CTF 2.5 Perspective effect tools

This repository has the perspective shaders for Windows and the source code of the Android version of the perspective object.

Both the shaders and the source code were extracted from the Five Nights at Freddy's Android remaster by Clickteam LLC.

For the source code of the original Windows extension, go [here](https://github.com/Andos/Perspective).
